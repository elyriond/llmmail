## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too vague:** "fashionable woman" → Specify exact clothing, pose, setting
2. **Missing lighting:** Always describe light source and quality
3. **No camera specs:** Technical details add realism
4. **Unclear composition:** Specify framing and angle
5. **Generic mood:** Use specific emotional descriptors
6. **Forgetting textures:** Fabric details make fashion come alive

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for DALL-E 3

1. **Reference Real Photographers:** "Inspired by Annie Leibovitz" or "Peter Lindbergh style"
2. **Magazine Source Prompts:** "From Vogue editorial" or "Harper's Bazaar cover shoot"
3. **Avoid Faces When Possible:** Use "masked," "viewed from behind," or "face obscured" for fewer distortions
4. **Emphasize Quality:** Always include "8K," "ultra high detail," "photorealistic"
5. **Layer Details:** 3-5 sentences covering all aspects creates best results
6. **Consistent Brand Aesthetic:** Match lighting and mood to brand identity

## 📊 Prompt Length Sweet Spot

**Ideal Length:** 3-5 detailed sentences (60-120 words)
- Sentence 1: Photography style + camera specs
- Sentence 2: Subject, clothing, pose details
- Sentence 3: Lighting description
- Sentence 4: Composition, setting, environment
- Sentence 5: Mood, color palette, quality markers

**Too Short:** < 30 words → Generic results
